# Dash Knight vs The Lizard Wizard
How to Playu
The Lizard Wizard picks a number 1-3 to hide behind the selected box. Once picked, our knight friend picks from the same set of numbers. If the Knight guesses correctly, then the Lizard Wizard losses 1 HP. Whereas if the Lizard is succesfully able to hide for the round, then the Knight will lose 1 HP. At then end of 3 rounds, whoever has the most HP is declared the winner.
Play as the legendary Super Knight as your goal is to rescue the princess from the spell that has been cast upon her by the "Evil" Lizard Wizard. The "Evil" Lizard Wizard had accidentally cast a spell on himself in the shower this morning and reverted himself to a pixelly nightmare. The princess had comeby just for a visit and to get smoothies and was unfortunately caught in the firing range of the spell, also turning her into a pixel abomination. With no other option, the King sent his most powerful knight, the Super Dash Knight to go and rescue the princess.
As the Lizard Wizard, you can hide behind one of 3 boxes. As the Knight, you have to shoot one of three boxes and whomever has the most HP at the end of shooting all three boxes is declared the winner.
