# Dash Knight vs The Lizard Wizard
Play as the legendary Super Knight as your goal is to rescue the princess from the spell that has been cast upon her by the "Evil" Lizard Wizard. The "Evil" Lizard Wizard had accidentally cast a spell on himself in the shower this morning and reverted himself to a pixelly nightmare. The princess had comeby just for a visit and to get smoothies and was unfortunately caught in the firing range of the spell, also turning her into a pixel abomination. With no other option, the King sent his most powerful knight, the Super Dash Knight to go and rescue the princess.
As the Lizard Wizard, you can hide behind one of 3 boxes. As the Knight, you have to shoot one of three boxes and whomever has the most HP at the end of shooting all three boxes is declared the winner.
